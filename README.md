# String Calculator TDD Kata

### Guidelines

-   Commit message Guidelines

1. I tried to follow basic `commit lint` rules
2. `tdd` at the very beginning explains the commit is for `test driven development` and not for other tasks like updating readme
3. `red phase` means the test is generated until it's failing
4. `green phase` means the production code is written in a way just the previous test will pass
5. `refactor` is basically performing any minor logical or whitespace changes. Can be in either test file or code file or both.
6. `additional test` are the tests implemented by me not mentioned in assignment to check if the code works and the code passes the test, so no code change required.

-   Noteworthy files

1. `index.ts`: the main source code for function
2. `__tests__/str_calc_tdd.test.ts`: all the tests are written here. For simplicity only one test suite is used.

### Tech stack and position

1. Position applied: `Node.js`
2. Language: `Typescript`
3. Compiler: `ts-node`
4. Test Runner: `jest`
5. Package manager: `pnpm`

### Available commands

1. `pnpm build`: build `js` files from `ts` following `es2016` standards
2. `pnpm dev`: run dev server with `nodemon`
